# Anime_Character_Drawing_Tool is malfunctioning please help me with that : if u run that program u will see that its drawing the random thick white line of the processed grayscale image converted from the original image : the thing is that i tried to map the processed grayscale image and it actually is good but when im trying to retrace it or a do a drawing simulation above problem is happening i tried 3 different approaches to counter this but still no luck. We can still see the traces of the character in that white pool but no as in the processed image grayscale version. if u could help with that ill really appreciate it.

This is a newbie's anime_character drawing/retracer tool, but its malfunctioning I need some help from u guys, thanks in advance

    # Words from the dev : There's still something lacking in this piece of code.
    # I tried three types different logic to draw this.
    # But the live_draw() is keeps printing the white line instead of the actual image processed.
    # It will be under maintenance for now.
    # If you could resolve this issue.
    # Please commit ur changes and ping me to commit ur version in the master/main file
    # Thanks, im still a beginner, so it would mean a lot to me.
